# Embeddings Demos with Gemini

## Overview
Embeddings are a powerful tool in machine learning, converting high-dimensional data such as text, images, or audio into lower-dimensional vectors. 
This repository provides a guide on how to use embeddings for various applications: similar text detection, clustering, classification, and question answering (Q&A).

## How to Use Embeddings for Similar Text
Embeddings can capture semantic similarities between texts by transforming them into vectors in a high-dimensional space.
Similar texts are represented by vectors that are close together.

### Steps
1. **Preprocess Text Data:** Clean and tokenize your text data.
2. **Generate Embeddings:** Use pre-trained models such as Vertex AI to generate embeddings for each text.
3. **Compute Similarity:** Calculate the similarity between text vectors using measures such as cosine similarity.
4. **Thresholding:** Define a similarity threshold to determine if texts are similar.

## How to Use Embeddings for Clustering
Embeddings can be used to group similar data points into clusters, revealing underlying patterns or structures within the data.

### Steps
1. **Preprocess Data:** Ensure your data is clean and appropriately tokenized.
2. **Generate Embeddings:** Use pre-trained models such as Vertex AI to generate embeddings for each text.
3. **Choose Clustering Algorithm:** Select a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) that suits your data and objectives.
4. **Cluster Data:** Apply the chosen clustering algorithm to the embeddings to form clusters.

## How to Use Embeddings for Classification
Embeddings can enhance classification tasks by providing dense and informative representations of input data.

### Steps
1. **Preprocess Data:** Prepare and clean your data.
2. **Generate Embeddings:** Use pre-trained models such as Vertex AI to generate embeddings for each text.
3. **Prepare Labels:** Ensure your data has appropriate labels for classification.
4. **Train Classifier:** Use the embeddings as input features to train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression, RandomForest).
5. **Evaluate Model:** Test the classifier on a validation set and use metrics like accuracy.

## How to Use Embeddings for Q&A
Embeddings can enhance Q&A systems by capturing the context and semantics of questions and answers.

### Steps
1. **Preprocess Data:** Tokenize and clean both questions and answers.
2. **Generate Embeddings:** Use pre-trained models such as Vertex AI to generate embeddings for each text.
3. **Similarity Matching:** For a given question, compute the similarity between its embedding and the embeddings of potential answers.
4. **Select Best Match:** Choose the answer with the highest similarity score as the best response.
5. **Use LLM:** Optionally, use a LLM to create a better answer
